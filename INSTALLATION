Quickstart:

In order to play around with post commit hooks, please
make sure the "post-commit" file in this directory is
executable, and link it to ./.git/hooks/post-commit with
the following command, run in the current top level
directory:

  ln -s ./post-commit ./.git/hooks/post-commit

More details coming soon.
