Quickstart:

In order to play around with post commit hooks, please
make sure the "post-commit" file in this directory is

the following command, run in the current top level
directory:

  ln -s ../../post-commit ./.git/hooks/post-commit


Verbose:

This is a git repository to play around with test driven
development.  I'm trying to do some stuff with git hooks.
But I'm not that familiar with them so I'm testing as I
go!  I think I'm getting the hang of it though.
