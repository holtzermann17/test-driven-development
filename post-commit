;; prepare-commit-msg
;;        This hook is invoked by git commit right after preparing the default log message, and before the editor is started.

;;        It takes one to three parameters. The first is the name of the file that contains the commit log message. The second
;;        is the source of the commit message, and can be: message (if a -m or -F option was given); template (if a -t option
;;        was given or the configuration option commit.template is set); merge (if the commit is a merge or a .git/MERGE_MSG
;;        file exists); squash (if a .git/SQUASH_MSG file exists); or commit, followed by a commit SHA1 (if a -c, -C or
;;        --amend option was given).

;;        If the exit status is non-zero, git commit will abort.

;;        The purpose of the hook is to edit the message file in place, and it is not suppressed by the --no-verify option. A
;;        non-zero exit means a failure of the hook and aborts the commit. It should not be used as replacement for pre-commit
;;        hook.


;;        The sample prepare-commit-msg hook that comes with git comments out the Conflicts: part of a merge's commit message.
