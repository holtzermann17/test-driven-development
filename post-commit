;;; Documentation:

;; This file demonstrates some simple post commit tricks
;; with Emacs.  It can print out simple changed lines in a
;; buffer.  We could feed these lines into the
;; test-driven-development.el file, or use this data from
;; inside that file to get a more interesting idea of the
;; "increment" to analyse.
;;
;; We might want to get the magit package into the loop to
;; more seamlessly commit things without leaving Emacs, or
;; without getting away from the usual development
;; workflow in Emacs.
;;
;; The main problem at the moment is that
;; test-driven-development.el uses ert in an interactive
;; manner.  We could also load all of the functions there
;; and run ert in a non-interactive manner, resulting in
;; more detailed output from this script.

;; That might be the easiest thing to do.  Note that we
;; ought to be able to doctor the commit message with
;; another command.

;;; Notes:

;; This is the old way to call emacs scripts
; :;exec emacs -batch -l "$0" -f main -- "$@"            
;(defun main ()
;  (princ (format "%d\n" (+ 1 2))))

;; Printing arguments back out.  Send in strings like this:
;; ./scriptname \"ABC\" def ghk
;;
;; - We don't use args for this particular script

;; prepare-commit-msg
;;        This hook is invoked by git commit right after preparing the default log message, and before the editor is started.

;;        It takes one to three parameters. The first is the name of the file that contains the commit log message. The second
;;        is the source of the commit message, and can be: message (if a -m or -F option was given); template (if a -t option
;;        was given or the configuration option commit.template is set); merge (if the commit is a merge or a .git/MERGE_MSG
;;        file exists); squash (if a .git/SQUASH_MSG file exists); or commit, followed by a commit SHA1 (if a -c, -C or
;;        --amend option was given).

;;        If the exit status is non-zero, git commit will abort.

;;        The purpose of the hook is to edit the message file in place, and it is not suppressed by the --no-verify option. A
;;        non-zero exit means a failure of the hook and aborts the commit. It should not be used as replacement for pre-commit
;;        hook.


;;        The sample prepare-commit-msg hook that comes with git comments out the Conflicts: part of a merge's commit message.
